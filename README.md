Fuzzgo
======

Demonstration of Efficient Fuzzy Matching techniques using MongoDB

This demonstrates the use of Metaphone, Garbled Search against a term index,
Multifield and quorum searching.

unpack the datafile in datagen then run `datagen.py` to generate 5 Million documents.

then run `fuzzgo.py`

Needs `pymongo` and `bottle`

This is my first python program - feel free to refactor all the code :-)
